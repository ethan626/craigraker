# craigraker
The smart craigslist scraper.





Example usage:

python craigraker.py -q your-search -w your-cl-location --color --verbose --sortlocation -s "for sale"

Craigraker can give a general overview of search results or dive into the ads and extract the contact information and ad text. 
Highlighting of the output can be done using the -c/--color flag, which uses ansi colors. 

Output is formatted for viewing in spreadsheet software. 

The default search section is the for sale section, other options are useable by passing the -s/--section flat with the desired section as an argument.
